# Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller
üöÄContains the Rocket Elevator files. New solution for the Residential sector. üìà

This code was developed for the new phase of Rocket Elevators, when expanding its business, the company needed a new program: a elevator controller in the residential sector.

üìå The program to develop is a controller set up in a 10 storey building served by 2 elevator
cages. This controller is capable of supporting two main events:

1. A person presses a call button to request an elevator, the controller selects an
available cage and it is routed to that person based on two parameters provided by
pressing the button:
- a. The floor where the person is
- b. the direction in which he wants to go (Up or Down)

‚ùó It should be noted that an elevator already in motion (or stopped but still
other requests to be completed) should be prioritized versus an "Idle" elevator.

2. A person enters an elevator, selects a floor of the control panel and it moves to the
floor requested. The parameter provided is the requested floor.

üéØ For this, we use the Python language.
This program contains the following Classes:
- Column, Elevator, CallButton, FloorRequestButton, Door.
Each class has its own methods.

‚ö°In the Column Class, we will have the following methods:
- createElevator: Responsible for creating the elevator. 
- createCallButtons: Responsible for creating the buttons, Up or Down of the 10 floors. 
- requestElevator: Responsible for handling the demand for an elevator, made by one person, or more. 
- findBestElevator: Responsible for analyzing all column elevators and assigning points to the best elevator for that elevator request. 
- checkIfElevatorISBetter: Responsible for checking the points of the previous function and choosing the best among the column elevators.

‚ö°In the Elevator Class, we will have the following methods:
- createFloorRequestButton: Responsible for creating the elevator's internal buttons.
- requestFloor: Responsible for handling the demand for a floor, or more, when you are inside the elevator.
- movElev: Responsible for moving the elevator.
- sortFloorList: Responsible for organizing the list of floors or elevators requested.
- capacityCalculate: Responsible for checking the lift's capacity, if it is safe to perform a movement.
- operateDoors: Responsible for checking the obstruction of a door.
